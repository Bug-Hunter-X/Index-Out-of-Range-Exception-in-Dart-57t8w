# Dart Index Out of Range Exception

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart: the `IndexOutOfRangeException`.  The `bug.dart` file contains code that attempts to access an element in a list using an invalid index, resulting in an exception.  The `bugSolution.dart` file provides a corrected version of the code that handles the potential error.

This example highlights the importance of carefully checking array indices before accessing elements to prevent runtime errors.
